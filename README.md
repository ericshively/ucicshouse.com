## Getting Started

If you don't have the repo:

git clone https://github.com/ericshively/ucicshouse.com.git

If you don't have Node.js / NPM, you'll need to install following the instructions here depending on OS:
https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm

First, install dependencies, and then run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the local result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
